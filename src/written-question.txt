Answer to the questions 2 and 7. 

I believe my response addresses both questions.

A. Once a web browser receives the necessary files including index.html and 
bundle.js, React creates and maintains a Virtual DOM that corresponds to the actual DOM.
When the state or props change, React updates the corresponding objects in the 
Virtual DOM and compares them to the previous virtual DOM using its diffing algorithm.
After detecting changes, React updates only the changed parts of the actual DOM.
